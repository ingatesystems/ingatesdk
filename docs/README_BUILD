Requirements on build host
==========================

This only needs to be performed once.

$ sudo python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
$ sudo python -m pip install tqdm
$ sudo python -m pip install --upgrade twine

Build
=====

* NOTE: Make sure that your changes work with both python 2 and 3.
* NOTE: If you only make changes to the utils directory you shouldn't
        bump the version/build the package and upload it to PyPI.

* Make your changes.
* Bump the version in setup.py.
* Run command:
      $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
* Create a tag e.g. v1.0.4.
  $ git tag -a v1.0.4 -m 'Version 1.0.4'
  $ git push --tags

Upload package to PYPI
======================

You should have a .pypirc file in your home directory. With
the following contents:

[distutils]
index-servers=
    test
    pypi

[test]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = ingatesystems

[pypi]
username = ingatesystems

[test] is for staging (good to use if want to check that everything is
fine before uploading to real [pypi] repository.

* You need the password for the ingatesystems user.

For stage (might be buggy, not a stable environment):

* Run the command:
          $ twine upload -r test dist/ingatesdk-1.0.4*

* Use pip to download the package:
          $ pip install --upgrade -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ingatesdk

The real deal:

* Run the command:
          $ twine upload -r pypi dist/ingatesdk-1.0.4*

* Use pip to download the package:
          $ pip install --upgrade ingatesdk
